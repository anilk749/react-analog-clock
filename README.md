# React Clock

This repository contains a simple React application showcasing both digital and analog clocks. The clocks display real-time updates using JavaScript's `Date` object and utilize React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects. The analog clock features dynamic clock hands rotation, while the digital clock displays time in a 12-hour format with leading zeros. This project serves as a demonstration of basic React concepts and real-time clock functionality.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
